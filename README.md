# What is this and How to...

This document is the permanently moderated collection of scripts, tools and applications I use, would like to use or something I probably try to use.

I edit it time to time and update passing it through the filter as follows:

```
git-md-toc -ut -- README.md
```

* `git-md-toc` - the Perl script for detecting/creating/updating the Table of Content. It is hosted at https://github.com/ildar-shaimordanov/git-markdown-toc.
